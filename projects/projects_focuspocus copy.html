        <p class="txt_small"><b>Smartphones have become our ubiquitous daily companion.</b> They support us in everyday tasks,
          enabling us to handle them more efficiently, and they can act as a “micro escape” from negative
          feelings or uncomfortable situations. <b>However, as smartphones give us easy access to engaging content, for example 
          on social media applications, they also challenge our self-regulation and can even become an addiction.</b>
          App developers are often more motivated to encourage user engagement than to provide a meaningful
          interaction. They keep the user in the loop with Attention Capture Damaging Patterns
          (ACDPs) like infinite scrolling and never-ending autoplay which draw the attention away from the user’s initial goal
          towards the content of the app. As a result, the user falls into a habitual passive consumption and loses control 
          over their smartphone usage. 
          <b>After the usage ends, affected users often feel a sense of regret as the interaction lacked
          meaning or interfered with the activities they initially had planned.</b>
          To combat this problem, researchers emphasize the need to improve the users’ digital well-being which is the impact 
          of digital technologies on a person’s well-being. 
          <b>Digital Self-Control Tools (DSCTs) help the user to regulate their smartphone usage and reduce the time 
          they spend on their devices</b>. While there are numerous commercial DSCTs, most of them are not scientifically
          based despite the growing research in this domain. Furthermore, approaches often focus on reducing the time the
          user spends on the device or in certain apps. In general, overuse may be one aspect of problematic smartphone usage.
          <b>However, the real challenge is to enable the user to avoid the kind of usage, they perceive as regretful,
          and encourage meaningful interaction instead.</b>
          </p>

      <div class="column" id="solution">
        <p class="txt_medium centered">Solution</p>
        <p class="txt_small">
          <b>One approach to encouraging meaningful interaction is to redirect the user’s attention from the regretful smartphone
          usage towards a different activity.</b> 
          In a <a class="link" href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3568444.3568465">related survey</a>,
          researchers discovered activities that users would have preferred to do instead of using their smartphone.
          With their outcome as a basis, <b>I developed FocusPocus, a novel DSCT that explores alternative activity suggestion 
          as a means for the user to regain their sense of agency.</b> I examined the usability of the tool and prepared for 
          a large-scale field study in an exploratory pilot study. In the study, participants used FocusPocus in their daily
          life for one week and answered questions about their smartphone usage and well-being in two questionnaires. 
          The results of the study suggest that alternative activity suggestions have the potential to improve users’ digital
          well-being and help them use their smartphone more meaningfully.

      <p class="txt_small">
        To get a current overview of scientific approaches to DSCT, we conducted a systematic literature
review following the PRISMA guidelines [68]. Table 3.1 lists the research questions that our
review addresses. We first analyze the proposed approaches to digital self-control based on the
intervention types they utilize, the time frame they intervene in, the goal they pursue and the
world they target. Then we use this analysis to visualize current research gaps for DSCTs. As a base, we use the existing review of Monge Roffarello and De Russis [60] and extend it with
more recent papers. Figure 3.1 shows our procedural flowchart. A larger version of this chart can
be found in the Appendix (see Figure 11.1). As described above, Monge Roffarello and De Russis reviewed papers that describe the motivations,
strategies, challenges and ethics, and evaluations of DSCTs [60]. As our review focuses on
concrete concepts or implementations of tools, we only considered the 45 papers that were examined
in terms of strategies. We excluded two of these because they were preliminary versions of
other papers also included in the review. The remaining 43 papers were integrated into our general
corpus.
Monge Roffarello and De Russis examined papers from the electronic database of the Association
for Computer Machinery (ACM) Guide to the Computing Literature6 that were published between
January 2000 and the 18th of June 2021 [60]. They formulated their search queries based on the 17
HCI papers reviewed by Lyngs et al. [50] and validated the search with a validation set including
the same papers [60].
To ensure the currency of our design space, we used the same search queries to extract ACM papers
from the 19th of June 2021 to the 23rd of May 2023. Additionally, we searched for papers
including the term "smartphone non-use" from January 2000 to the 23rd of May 2023. We added
this term as it is a common keyword in recent work, used for example by Almoallim and Sas [2].
Table 3.2 lists all search queries and the number of papers that each query resulted in.
For scaling reasons, we excluded the results of the search queries 1 and 2. As these terms are quite
general, they yielded exceptionally large lists. Many of the resulting papers were not relevant for
our search objective, like papers from the domain of mental health. For this reason, we focused
on the queries that were formulated more precisely and resulted in condensed lists. Query 8 was
excluded as it only yielded papers already included in query 7. The remaining search queries
resulted in 253 papers. We used the tool Rayyan.ai 7 to identify and remove 40 duplicates. Then
we continued using it for the title and abstract screening.
Papers that targeted digital well-being with an intervention approach were eligible for inclusion.
We further excluded papers that met any of the following exclusion criteria:
• articles discussing the topic of digital well-being in a generic way, without focusing on any
behavior change interventions;
• articles discussing or analyzing behavior change interventions that do not explicitly target
the usage of devices and/or online services, e.g., interventions against sedentary lifestyles;
• articles presenting pure parental-control solutions, with interventions that are not defined by
the users themselves but rather externally imposed, e.g., by parents;
• limited research reports, magazines, and editorials;
• articles not presenting a concrete digital self-control tool.
Monge Roffarello and De Russis [60] introduced the first four exclusion criteria. As we are only
interested in concrete implementations or concepts, we additionally excluded any paper that did
not present a DSCT. After the screening, 163 papers were excluded. Finally, we conducted a
full-text assessment that resulted in the exclusion of 32 more papers. Two papers remained inaccessible,
which meant that 16 papers were included after the reviews. We further included one
paper [58] that we found by snowballing. This is a commonly used technique in systematic literature
studies in which the reference list of a paper is screened for additional papers [93]. In
our case, Monge Roffarello and De Russis mentioned the additional paper in another one that we
excluded [57].
In total, we added a list of 17 papers to the original corpus resulting in a general corpus of 60
papers. These papers describe 56 distinct DSCTs. All papers included in the review and their
proposed approaches are listed in the Appendix (see Table 11.1 and Table 11.2). We also marked
them in the references (X) and added a second mark (z) if the paper was not already included in
the review of Monge Roffarello and De Russis. Figure 3.2 shows the distribution of the publication
years in our general corpus. The included papers have been published in a time span of ten
years, between 2013 and May 2023, with most published in 2021.

We created a data extraction sheet to systematically extract data from our general corpus. First,
we sorted the papers by the DSCT they describe. There were often several papers about different
versions of one tool, for example of Socialize [55, 56, 59], or even the same version in the case
of Chirp [6, 95]. The next columns characterized each paper by title, author, publication date
and conference or journal it was published in. Then we analyzed the presented DSCT. We first
noted the platform the tool was developed for, differing between smartphone and other devices.
Next we coded the various aspects of our first research question (Q1). This included the time of
intervention, the goal of the DSCT, the implemented intervention features and finally the target
world of the intervention. In the next section, we present the results of the review in form of a
multi-dimensional design space.
